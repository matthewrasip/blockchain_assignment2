## Hello grader
Whenever you wish to test this site, please change the values located in `data/InventoryX` - each of the `p`, `q`, `e` variables along with `identity` and `rand_int` are easily accessible.
Remember to save your work so the methods can correctly calculate with your chosen integers.

# Ready to run?
Whenever you're ready to run, please launch `app.py` - you may chnage vairables after starting, it should restart the server with the new variables loaded/calculated.
